### About Development enviroment
*to be added at later time*

### Configure appsettings.json
Before you can build and run this project, you have to create 2 files for application setting:
- appsettings.json
- appsettings.Development.json

This repo does not provide appsettings files by default because it's not ideal to expose many sensitive key informations to public. However, you can find the example on `appsettings-template.json` inside `Miscellaneous` folder.
